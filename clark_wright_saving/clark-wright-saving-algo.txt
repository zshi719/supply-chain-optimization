for every pair (i, j) of demand points DO
	Calculate the savings s(i, j) = d(D, i) + d(D, j) - d(i, j) 

sort savings s(i, j) in descending order in the savings list

create empty routes
create lists storing the remaining customer to be served
set the vehicle capacity 

get a list of nodes
remove the depot 

Find the first element in the sorted list

if there are remaining customers to be served:
	for savings s(i, j)
		if savings(i, j) > 0 DO
				
			if i not in a route AND j not in a route: 
				create a new route with link (i,j)
				
			if (i in an existing route and i not interior to that route (not adjacent to the depot):
				if j not in  an existing route:
					add link (i, j) to the same route
			else if (j in an existing route and j not interior to the route (not adjacent to the depot):
				if i not in  an existing route:
					 add link (i, j) to the same route

			 if (i in an existing route and j in another existing route
				if i not adjacent to depot AND j not adjacent to depo
					merge the two routes.
